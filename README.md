Register Naming
=======================

We implemented Register Renaming, which is the allocation stage in the pipeline of the microarchitecture of processors.
Name dependencies are caused by the reuse of registers without involving any data dependencies. To maximize the
instruction-level parallelism, Register Renaming entails changing the names of the register to avoid false dependencies.
